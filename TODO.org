* TODO Add yaml support
* TODO Experiment with stacked autoencoders and an mlp
* TODO Manually vary learning rate by orders of magnitude (.1, .01, .001, etc)
* TODO Experiment with varying batch sizes (the time required to train them)
** To optimize the amount of time required to move data to the GPU (transfer to GPU is expensive/slow)
