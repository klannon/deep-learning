this project contains python code that attempts to go deeper than any physicist has gone before by applying deep learning to high-energy physics in novel ways.


Installing the stuff
--------------------
1. Get the stuff we didn't write
* [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/)
* [Pylearn2](http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/)
2. Get the stuff we wrote
* `git clone https://github.com/klannon/deep-learning.git`
3. Set the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable
* 'cd deep-learning'
* 'setenv PYTHONPATH $PWD'

If you're planning on using this a lot, consider adding the PYTHONPATH environment variable to your .cshrc or .profile so you don't have to keep setting it
